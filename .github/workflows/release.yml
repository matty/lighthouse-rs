# This workflow builds both the Tauri GUI application and CLI tool,
# then creates a GitHub release with the standalone executables.
#
# Artifacts produced:
#   - Lighthouse Manager.exe (GUI application)
#   - lighthouse-manager.exe (CLI tool)
#
# Triggers: Push to tags matching v* (e.g., v1.0.0, v0.2.1)
